📄 Project Description:
The Daily Expense Tracker is a simple command-line Python application that allows users to track daily spending by adding expense entries with a description, amount, and the current date. It also enables users to view all their recorded expenses and see a total of the amount spent.

All data is stored in a local text file (expenses.txt), making it lightweight and easy to use for personal budgeting and small-scale financial tracking.

✅ Key Features:
📌 Add Expense:
Allows the user to input a description and amount. The app automatically records the current date and saves the entry to a file.

📄 View Expenses:
Displays all previously recorded expenses and calculates the total amount spent.

📂 Persistent Storage:
All expense entries are saved in a expenses.txt file for future access.

🔒 Error Handling:
Handles missing file scenarios (e.g., if expenses.txt doesn’t exist).

🧰 Technologies Used:
🐍 Python 3

📁 File Handling (open, readlines, write)

📅 datetime module for capturing the date

🖥️ Console I/O for user interaction
